    <h1>Introducing Tone-based Surfaces in Material 3</h1>
    <img src="../assets/cover.png" />
    <p>
      The previous way makers could achieve tinted surfaces, which are a
      hallmark of the M3 design language, was to assign the color role “surface”
      to a component, and increase its elevation to achieve the desired tinting
      which was applied via an opacity layer.
    </p>

        Pre-update: A tinted overlay communicated the elevation of a component
        surface
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The update introduces dedicated surface color roles that are no longer
      tied to elevation. Makers will be able to choose the right surface roles
      based on the containment needs of their products, and now have more layout
      flexibility for largSer screens.
    </p>
    <video src="../assets/surface-blog-sequence-new.mov" autoplay></video>
    <p>
      The new <strong>surface container</strong> roles and tokens include five
      colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surface container” is the recommended default color role for a contained
      area against the “surface” color role. It provides good contrast and can
      be flexibly combined with all other surface container roles ranging from
      “surface container lowest” with the lowest emphasis against the “surface”
      role, to “surface container highest” with the highest emphasis against the
      “surface” role.
    </p>
    <h2>Migrating to the new <code>surface color</code> roles</h2>
    <p>
      All Material Components will automatically update to use the new surface
      container color roles. For makers using the previous opacity-based surface
      model for custom color mappings, we recommend remapping these to the new
      roles.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Surface Container Lowest is a new role</li>
      <li>Surface at elevation +1 becomes Surface Container Low</li>
      <li>Surface at elevation +2 becomes Surface Container</li>
      <li>Surface at elevation +3 becomes Surface Container High</li>
      <li>
        Surface at elevation +4 and +5 are being deprecated, it is recommended
        to use Surface Container Highest by default as a replacement. As an
        alternative Surface Container High, or Surface Dim can be used depending
        on the specific use case.
      </li>
      <li>Surface Variant becomes Surface Container Highest</li>
    </ul>
